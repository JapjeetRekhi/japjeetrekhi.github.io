I am a passionate and hard-working engineer who has always been inspired by innovation and competition. I am regularly learning new things and reinforcing what I have learned by doing some side projects or by teaching it to someone. My ultimate goal in life is to improve peoplesâ€™ lives, be it through tech or some other medium.

I love coffee, football (soccer for all you North American folks), chess, reading books, and listening to songs (huge Coldplay fan). You can check out my playlists [here](https://open.spotify.com/user/i00as4onhh3gtwpwz8wfl764b). 

My Myers-Briggs Type Indicator (MBTI) is ENFP-A [Extraverted Intuitive Feeling Prospecting Assertive]. The favorite people I supposedly share my personality type with are Robert Downey Jr, Robin Williams, Will Smith, and Michael Scott (The Office). You can take the test [here](https://www.16personalities.com/free-personality-test). 

If you want to discuss something with me or want to say Hi, connect with me on LinkedIn [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/japjeetrekhi) or send me a [mail](mailto:japjeetsingh.rekhi@stonybrook.edu).
